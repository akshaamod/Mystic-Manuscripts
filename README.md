# Mystic Manuscripts
## Overview
The aim of this project was to create a Quality Control Form ([QCF](https://github.com/akshaamod/Mystic-Manuscripts/blob/main/QCF/Quality%20Control%20Form.pdf)) for the given dataset. We started of by creating the table and importing the dataset's content onto SQL, and then made any relevant updates or alterations. We then carried out the quality-control checks on Excel and SQL, whose result we recorded in our QCF document.
